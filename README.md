# PyBer_Analysis
MatPlotLib

## Overview

This project aims to analyze Pyber rideshare data to reveal rider demographics and ride fare metrics by city. We use analysis and visualizations to create a roadmap for Pyber decision makers tp optimize their future business. 

## Results

- Revenue is higher when drivers are > = riders

- Rural cities have the highest average fare

- Urban cities have the highest demand

- Rural cities have the least demand

- Suburban cities have the highest driver/rider ratio

## Summary

 All city types differ greatly. Ultimately, urban cities have the most demand and are producing the most revenue. Drivers in rural areas are earning more than drivers in urban areas per ride, but with significantly less demand. This lack of demand could be due to the higher average fare per ride. Further analysis could reveal whether or not the lack of demand in rural cities is affected by other factors. Urban cities are the primary driver of revenue. More analysis is needed to determine whether suburban or rural cities would be the most efficient area to target future business growth.
